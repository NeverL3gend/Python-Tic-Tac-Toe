# Tic Tac Toe Pyton Project

I'm currently learning Python, so when the time comes i can become a Software Engineer. So im beginning my journey with a simple game project,
Tic Tac Toe a familar game that everyone knows.

## Tech Stack

**Language:** Python Version 2.7.18



## Notes on how I'm planning to build
1.  Greet the players that are playing. 
2. I want to have a Heads or Tales logic to determine who goes first 
3. How I think this should work is that each spot are going to be put in a list
 - first row = [0,1,2]
 - Second row =[3,4,5]
 - Third row = [6,7,8]
 
# Winning logic 
- Straight across: [0,1,2] , [3,4,5] , [6,7,8]
- Diagonal: [0,4,8] , [2,4,6]
- Vertical: [0,3,6] , [1,4,7] , [2,5,8]

## Current Stage of the Project

Today I currently worked on the Heads and tails logic, which it is working but currently there are some things that still need to added before that part is considered complete.
